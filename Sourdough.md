# SOURDOUGH

## Caring for sourdough starter

Keep it in the fridge so you don't have to feed it as often

Feed every 4-5 days while in the fridge

### When feeding it:

discard any liquid that's at the top

feed 1:1 water:flour. For example 50g water, 50g flour. Or 100g flour, 100g water. The amount you feed depends on how much starter you want and how active you want it to be.

If your jar is full to the brim with starter, remove the amount of starter in weight that you're going to feed it with. For example if you fed it 50g water and 50g flour, remove 100g starter.

### Does it matter what kind of water/flour you feed it with?
Not really, but I use bottled water and strong white flour. Bottled water as it doesn't have chlorine, and strong white flour so it provides gluten.


## Making a sourdough - my basic dough
My recipe is loosely based on this excellent guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJEjW-QSnQ

This can be broken up into 5 parts:
1. Preparing the levain (starter that's ready to use in baking) - Day 1-> Day 2
2. Forming the dough - Day 2
3. Coil folds
4. Shaping and slow ferment (resting the dough overnight in the fridge) - Day 2->Day 3
5. Baking - Day 3

### 1. Preparing the levain
Starter that is kept in the fridge is sluggish and poor to bake with. Preparing a levain means making the starter really lively and active so that it will give you a nice airy loaf instead of a dense loaf. This video is a comprehensive walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beKzcOe6w_o
1. Take starter out of fridge. Put 15g starter in a fresh jar. Feed with 30g water, 30g flour. 
2. Lightly cover the jar with the lid (leave a tiny gap so it can breathe) and leave it at room temperature.
3. Wait until it's doubled in volume, this can take 8 hours. I do this at midday on Day 1. I mark the jar with a pen to track its growth.
4. After the starter has doubled, start a fresh jar with 30g of the nicely grown starter. Feed with 95g flour, 95g water.
5. Leave overnight/8 hours/until it's doubled again. At this point, the starter is ready to be used in a dough.

### 2. Forming the dough
#### Ingredients:
* 200g starter
* 200g water
* 300g flour
* 5g salt
1. Mix all the ingredients together in a big bowl.
2. Mix and knead until the dough doesn't stick to the sides of the bowl.
3. Transfer the combined dough to a lightly oiled bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes, when you'll do your first coil fold:

### 3. Coil folds
Folding the dough throughout the fermentation period generates strength in the dough and makes it taut instead of floppy. Coil folds make a dough rise up during the bake instead of melting into a flat disc.

Here's how to fold: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc

1. With wet hands (to prevent sticking), do the first coil fold. Cover the dough and let it rest.
2. Wait 20 minutes, uncover the dough and coil fold again.
3. Repeat these steps until the dough doesn't melt into a flat disk. For me it takes 5 coil folds.

### 4. Shaping and slow ferment
1. After the last coil fold, let the dough rest for 20 minutes and shape the dough.
For this step, it's better to see the shaping in action than to read step by steps. The important thing about shaping is that you keep one side dry (one side floured on the countertop) and one side sticky. Here's a great guide on how to shape a dough: https://youtu.be/HlJEjW-QSnQ?t=732
2. Heavily flour a tea towel. Place the dough dry side down.
3. Heavily flour the whole dough so it doesn't stick to the tea towel
4. Place the tea towel inside a bowl and then cover the whole bowl and dough so that no moisture can escape (a tied-up plastic bag works well!)
5. Rest the dough in the fridge for 18 hours.

### 5. Baking
Cast iron Dutch ovens are great vessels to bake in. I bake my dough in an upside-down Dutch oven.
1. Preheat the dutch oven in the oven on maximum temperature (250c for me) for at least 30 mins
2. Tip the dough straight from the fridge onto the preheated dutch oven.
3. Score the top of the dough with a sharp knife or razor blade. The cuts should be deep and swift.
4. Bake at 250c for 25 minutes
5. Uncover the Dutch oven and lower the temperature to 220c. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the crust is deep brown and golden.
6. Remove from oven. Let rest for an hour.
7. Watch as the bread that was a 3-day labour of love disappears in 5 minutes.


## Miscellaneous notes:
### What's the difference between strong flour and plain flour?
Strong flour has more protein. Protein content in flour determines how much gluten your dough will have, which translates into how stretchy and flexible it is. I use flour which has a 13% protein content for both feeding my starter and forming the dough.

### Autolysis - an optional bonus step.
Before forming your dough, you can "autolyse" the flour/water ingredients. This simply means pre-mixing the flour and water together (in the recipe above, that's the 300g flour, 200g water). Autolysis builds strength in the dough without kneading. The flipside is that combining the starter and salt with the autolsyed mixture can be tricky and messy.

1. Mix floud and water together in a bowl until there's no loose flour left.
2. Let the mixture rest for about an hour or until you can pinch the top of the dough and pull a really long stretchy piece out without it tearing.
3. Combine the autolysed mixture with the salt and starter until the dough doesn't stick to the sides of the bowl.
